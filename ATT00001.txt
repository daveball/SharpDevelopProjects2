Dear DAVE BALL-MPKI CLIENT-PRIVATE,
 
Thank you for requesting an additional Administrator ID for a Managed PKI Account. At this time, we cannot approve your Administrator ID for one or more of the following reasons:

+ We were unable to verify the organization's information;
+ We were unable to verify you as an authorized administrator for the organization; or
+ We have not received your payment.

If any of your organizational contacts have changed, please work with Enterprise Authentication to update them.
